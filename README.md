# sentinel
The Sentinel is an open-source surveillance camera for students and other poor people. 
Over time, it will be sculpted into a tool that college students can hang in their dorms and library cubicles, 
and it will monitor a small perimeter around itself. This is not a full-blown surveillance system for large houses, 
but for tiny apartments and dorm rooms.
